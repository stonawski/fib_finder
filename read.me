Create a grid of 50x50. When you click on a cell, all values in the

cells in the same row and column are increased  by 1. If a cell is

empty, it will get a value of 1. After each change a cell will briefly

turn yellow. If 5 consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence

are next to each other, these cells will briefly turn green and will

be cleared.
